This website will take in user input and respond with semi-randomized output.


## Milestone 1 Feedback

- The purpose was vague.
- There is php code in the file preventing it from loading in a browser at all.
- What needs would your PWP satisfy for the User Persona.

### Feedback for Re-submission of Milestone 1
Good job making the purpose more specific.

Your grade for Milestone 1 is tier 2

## Milestone 2a Feedback

* Your documentation part of this is well done.  You have a nice, clear outline of the sections.
* Your wireframes don't show enough of your site, or have enough detail in them.  I can't tell what your website will do from them.
* The interface section sounds interesting, but I don't understand what you're planning to do with it.  User-based feedback seems interesting, but what functionality will you be providing?
* Your git commits are clean and bite-sized.  Well done.

Overall, you have a good discussion of the sections of your site, but your wireframes need more work.  Neither your interface nor your contact form is present on either of your wireframes, and they should be.  Your interface in particular is critical to your site, as it is the heart of your site's content.  If something is that important, it should be clearly laid out in your wireframe so that you can make the build process simply an execution of a clearly laid out plan.

The current grade for this is a Tier I.  Please resubmit this.  We'll give you details in slack.

### Milestone 2a resubmission

* You've cleaned up your wireframes, which is the most critical piece of this.
* I'm still not completely clear on what your interface will do, but I think it's fine to leave that off until later.

This resubmission grades at a Tier II.  You're cleared to move on to Milestone 2b.

## Milestone 2b Feedback

There isn't any actual content yet. Your content strategy was to have intereation based on user input. This should be show some functionality at this point but it does not.
This milestone was submitted late.

Your grade for milesone 2b is Tier 1

## Milestone 3 Feedback
While the PWP project is complete, it lacks a few items that could have bumped up the grade significantly. The entry form that is on the page does not function at all. The lack of styling throughout the project is another thing to note. Although there is Bootstrap implementation, there is a major lack of CSS. This is a very bare project which barely meets the minimum requirements of a tier 1 grade. Please see Paul for further instruction on what the next steps are in moving forward with your project.

### Milestone 3 Resubmission
You've hit the major goals of the resubmission.  You have styling in place, there are three pieces of functionality for the JS interface section, and the other aspects of the site are still working.  Although there are further opportunities for this site to be better with further styling or flashier JavaScript interface widgets, this is sufficient to meet the requirements.

**The Milestone 3 grade is a Tier II.**

**The overall grade for your PWP is Tier II.**
